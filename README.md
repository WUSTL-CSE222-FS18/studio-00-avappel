# Studio 0

## Part 1: Markdown Practice

The first part of this studio is practice with Markdown. Complete each of the following exercises:

You can preview what your Markdown file will look like when styles are added by using Particle Desktop's Markdown Preview feature. To do so:
1. Go to the `Packages` Menu.
1. Select the `Markdown Preview` submenu.
1. Select `Toggle Preview` (You may also want to make a note of the shortcut keys listed so you can quickly open the preview in the future).

***Q1. The above paragraph and this sentence use markdown in a few ways.  Give a brief description of anything unusual you notice.  Just enter your description on the lines below:***

There is a numbered ordered list, which is initialized by typing `1.` before each consecutive item. `Packages`, `Markdown Preview`, and `Toggle Preview` are put into blocks using back ticks.  

### Lists

Create a numbered list of five of your favorite foods in-order from favorite to least favorite in the designated area below. Be sure to include at least two things that are made of multiple ingredients.  

For each item that has multiple ingredients, create a sub list of a few (2-5) of the ingredients.  Make one of the sub-lists numbered and the other should use bullet points. (It should look like an outline: The ingredients for item n are indented and immediately below item n, but before item n+1)

***Q2. Create your list here:***

1. Mediterranean
    1. Pita Bread
    1. Olives
    1. Choice of Meat
    1. Italian
* Pasta
    * Cheese
    * Sauce
1. Sushi
    * Seaweed
    * Rice
    * Choice of Fish
    * Soy Sauce
1. Mexican
    * Choice of bread
    * Choice of meat
    * Vegetables
    * Salsa
1. American
    * Fries
    * Cheese
    * Hamburger Bun
    * Hamburger Patty
    * BLT

### Headings

Headings and sub-headings help separate the content of a document.

***Q3. Add a new third tier heading to this document named "My Heading" here:***

## Part 1: My Heading Here:

### Code

Markdown is often used to document code.  Consequently, it supports embedding code within documents.

***Q4. Create a code block below and include a Java `for`-loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10. Be sure to indicate that it's Java, which will cause Java keywords to be highlighted (for example, depending on your configuration `for` may be purple in the preview window; `int` may be orange, etc.):***

```java
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

## Part 2: What is IoT

This class is about IoT.  [Postscapes](https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-examples/) has a list of examples of IoT.  Pick any three categories (Body, Home City, Industry, etc.) and review any one example of each.

***Q5.  Based on your reviews, create a table of the top four distinguishing features of IoT applications. One column of the table should have a brief name for the feature (1-4 words) and the second column should have an explanation:***

Name | Explanation
------------ | -------------
Internet connectivity | Most IoT applications utilize the internet to update useful information within the application.
Human Aid | Most IoT applications seek to simplify or improve an aspect of human life.
Use of hardware | IoT applications use special hardware with sensors to then implement the work that they seek to automate.
Efficiency | Whether with regards to power, time, or other resources, IoT applications strive to make work more efficient.


Search for some additional IoT examples at other sites and find two examples that you find interesting.

***Q6.  For each example: 1) provide a link to it, 2) provide a brief summary of it, and 3) explain how it corresponds to distinguishing features you identified above and/or or how you may want to revise your list of distinguishing features.  Use lists/sublists to format your answer to this question (A numbered list of 2 items, each of which as 3 sub-items):***

1. https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011
    * Amazon's advanced automated shopping solution.
    * This application uses internet to connect to the users' phones to perform the sale. It seeks to simplify the experience of shopping for humans, removing the necessity to wait in line to purchase items at a store. It uses sensors to track which items were removed from the store to then place the items in the customers' virtual cart. Altogether, this service provides an unprecedented level of efficiency in shopping, saving time for consumers, and money for businesses.
1. https://nest.com
    * Nest is an smart home innovation in the form of a smart thermostat.
    * Nest connects to the users' mobile devices in order to determine where they are, so it can better adjust the temperature in a home to save energy. It simplifies life for humans, as it adapts to changes in temperature settings normally set by humans, eventually learning to make changes to the temperature without their input.

## Part 3: Comparing with Peers

Compare your previous work with other people in the class and try to come to a consensus about what IoT is about.

***Q7. Meet someone new.  Find a class member who you don't already know and introduce yourself.  Compare your work conclusions to the above IoT questions. Again, using a list indicate: 1) Who you worked with, and 2) Any discrepancies or interesting observations that arise from comparing your work:***

***Q8. Meet someone else new.  Find another class member who you don't already know and introduce your self.  Again compare your work as before:***
